.TH URLSCAN 1 "December 10, 2006"

.SH NAME
urlscan \- browse the URLs in an email message from a terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBurlscan\fR [options] <
.I message

\fBurlscan\fR [options]
.I message

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBurlscan\fR accepts a single email message on standard
input, then displays a terminal-based list of the URLs in the given
message.  Selecting a URL will invoke \fBsensible-browser\fR(1) on it
(and hence any browser specified in the \fBBROWSER\fR environment
variable).

\fBurlscan\fR is primarily intended to be used with the
.B mutt
(1) mailreader, but it should work well with any terminal-based mail
program.

\fBurlscan\fR is similar to \fBurlview\fR(1), but has the following
additional features:

\fB1.\fR Support for more message encodings, such as quoted-printable
and base64.

\fB2.\fR Extraction and display of the context surrounding each URL.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-background
Run the Web browser in the background, so you can select another URL
without closing it (this will not work with terminal-based Web
browsers such as lynx, links, or w3m).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-compact
Display a simple list of the extracted URLs, instead of showing the
context of each URL.

.SH MUTT INTEGRATION

To integrate urlscan with mutt, include the following two commands in
\fB~/.muttrc\fR:


.ad l
macro index,pager \\cb "<pipe-message> urlscan<Enter>" "call urlscan to extract URLs out of a message"

macro attach,compose \\cb "<pipe-entry> urlscan<Enter>" "call urlscan to extract URLs out of a message"
.ad b


Once these lines are in your mutt configuration file, pressing
Control-b will allow you to browse and open the URLs in the currently
selected message.
